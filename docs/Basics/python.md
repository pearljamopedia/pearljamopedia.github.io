Sure, you could install your own python (and you can!), but if you want to just use one that works well with PennLincKit, all you have to do is the following

If you want it to be your default:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="/cbica/home/<username>/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
If you want it for a session:
```bash
export PATH="/cbica/home/<username>/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
```
