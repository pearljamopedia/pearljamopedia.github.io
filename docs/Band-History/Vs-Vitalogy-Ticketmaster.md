# The release of Vs.

At the [1993 MTV Video Music Awards], Pearl Jam received four awards for the music video for ["Jeremy"](https://google.com) including **Video of the Year** and **Best Group Video**. Afterwards, the band publicly made an effort to refrain from doing a music video for ["Black"](https://google.com), despite pressure from the record label. This brought the band to make a very small amount of music videos along the way, as the band did not want "people to remember our songs as videos". 

In February of 1993, Pearl Jam entered the studio once more to record their second album, [Vs.](https://google.com). The record sold almost one million (950,378) copies in the first week following its release, and even set the record for most copies of an album sold within the first week of release (which was then surpassed in 1998). The album contained the singles ["Go"](https://google.com), ["Daughter"](https://google.com), ["Animal"](https://google.com), and ["Dissident"](https://google.com)

## The Ticketmaster legal battle

In 1994, Pearl Jam played two charity shows in [Chicago, Illinois](https://google.com), however, the band was furious when it had found out that ticket vendor [Ticketmaster](https://google.com) was adding a service charge to tickets. The band was committed to keeping ticket prices down but the company refused to remove the charge.
