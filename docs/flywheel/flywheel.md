# Using UPenn's Flywheel Instance
{: .no_toc }

Data collected at UPenn research scanners is anonymized and uploaded to
[Flywheel](https://upenn.flywheel.io). You need a PennKey to log in to Flywheel and
need to be added to projects by your lab's Flywheel administrator. In addition
to storing data, Flywheel can also process your data with its "gears". You will
interact with Flywheel either through your web browser or using the Flywheel
Standard Development Kit (SDK) from Python.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }


## Connecting with a browser

In any browser (preferably Google Chrome), you can access Flywheel by visiting upenn.flywheel.io.

## Installing the Flywheel SDK

This assumes that you've already [installed miniconda](/docs/Basics/basics/#installing-python) and are using a python environment you have administrative rights to (ie you've run `conda activate`). To check that you're using the correct environment run

```bash
$ which pip
/Users/my_account/miniconda3/envs/my_env/bin/pip
```

and see that `pip` is being used from within your conda environment. Now you can install the SDK using

```bash
$ pip install flywheel-sdk
```


## Connecting with the SDK

The flywheel CLI allows you to communicate with Flywheelâ€™s database. Follow their instructions [here](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008162214). Once installed and logged in, you should see your username when you do:
```
$ fw status
$ You are currently logged in as Tinashe Tapera to https://upenn.flywheel.io
```
