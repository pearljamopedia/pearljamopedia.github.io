# The release of *No Code* and *Yield*

After touring for [Vitalogy](https://google.com), Pearl Jam returned to the studio to record their 1996 album, *[No Code]*(https://google.com). The album debuted at number one on the [Billboard](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Brands-Companies/Billboard) charts, however it quickly fell back down. The album contained the singles ["Who You Are"](https://google.com), ["Hail, Hail"](https://google.com), and ["Off He Goes"](https://google.com). Once again, the band did not tour very much, this being caused by their [battle with Ticketmaster](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Band-History/Vs-Vitalogy-Ticketmaster/#the-ticketmaster-legal-battle). *No Code* was released on August 27, 1996, exactly 5 years after the release of [Ten](https://google.com).

In 1997, Pearl Jam entered the studio once again to record [Yield](https://google.com). On Feburary 3, 1998, *Yield* was released. The album, once again, debuted high on the Billboard charts, at number two. However, like its predecessor, it dropped quickly. The album contained the singles ["Given to Fly"](https://google.com) and ["Wishlist"](https://google.com). A documentary, [Single Video Theory](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/Single-Video-Theory), capturing the making of the album, was released on August 4, 1998.

Due to tiredness and dissatisfaction from excessive touring, drummer [Jack Irons](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Past-Members/Jack-Irons) left the band. He was (initially temporarily, but eventually permanently) replaced by former [Soundgarden](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Bands/Soundgarden) drummer, [Matt Cameron](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Current-Members/Matt-Cameron), and Cameron was the drummer for the rest of the tour. A live album, [Live on Two Legs](https://google.com) was put together from different performances from the successful 1998 tour.
