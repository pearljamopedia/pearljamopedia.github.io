# CONCUR Reimbursement SOP
Reimbursement for expenses (typically: conference travel) is one of the most administratively demanding tasks in the lab. The goal of this wiki (created by Sophia Linguiti and now maintained by Lia Brodrick) is to make this processess as efficient as possible and reduce headaches. Nonetheless, there are many compliance requirements and as such it is strongly reccomended that this instructions are closely adhered to.  If there are aspects that need clarification please contact Lia Brodrick (cc Ted) so we can keep this wiki up to date.

For all lab-related expenses that you wish to have reimbursed via the CONCUR system follow the documentation outlined below. If you have a PennKey then you are able to submit reimbursements.  It is _essential_ that this be done in a timely manner; Penn policy prohibits reimbursements after 6 months.  Please submit expenses immediately after they are incurred and allow for a lengthy administrative review process.

Note that questions regarding reimbursement can be posted to the #concur slack channel to preserve knowledge over time.

For allowable expenses and funding for travel, please see the [travel guidelines wiki](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/LabHome/TravelGuidelines/).


## Overview of Steps to Reimbursement: 
Explanation on how to complete each step is listed below

1. Prepare expenditure justification form
2. Send receipts and expenditure justification to Sharon Liu and John Hyon for pre-review
3. Incorporate feedback and submit receipts and expenditure justification via CONCUR
4. You will receive notice if it has been approved via email


## Prepping the Expenditure Justification Reports
For each expenditure you must first prepare the standardized Expenditure Justification report.   It is STRONGLY encouraged to use a previously approved justification report examples to avoid multiple rounds of rejection and revision.   Prior examples can be found on PennBox (you can ask Lia to be shared on the CONCUR folder). It is encouraged to retain as much wording from previously approved documents as possible while maintaining accuracy. A blank copy of the expenditure justification form can be found [here](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ggeb/assets/user-content/Financial%20Forms/penn-a21-form.pdf).


### Fill Out Expenditure Form
_Project Title_: Fill in the name of the study the expense will be billed to

_Principle Investigator_: Dr. Theodore Satterthwaite

_Project/Grant Number_: This is the funding nickname for project/Sponsor. Please ask Ted what fund to use.

_Funding Source_: This is a 26 digit budget code.  Lia has these.   You can always ask John Hyon if you are unsure of the funding source number.

_Description of Expense_: Brief description including how the expense was paid for and to which vendor. (ex. To reimburse Dr. Satterthwaite for monthly subscription to CircleCI vendor for data management)

_Amount of Expense_: Total amount requesting reimbursement, itemize if necessary.

_Date of Expense_: Date that the transaction occurred

_Explanation or Cost Allocation and Justification of Expense_: Fill out why the expense was necessary. See examples and modify as needed.

_Signature_: Obtain Ted's signature (or PI of grant if not Ted)


### Approval from Business Administrator, John Hyon
Send the prepared Expenditure Justification in word document form to both Sharon Liu (xgliu@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) and John Hyon (Hyon1@pennmedicine.upenn.edu) for pre-review BEFORE submitting via concur.  Please cc Ted and Lia on all emails regareding reimbursement. 

Make sure to also send the receipt for all expenses. The receipt _must include_ the confirmation of payment (not just the invoice), how the payment was made (typically last 4 digits of the card listed on receipt), each expense itemized, the total amount paid, and the date the payment was completed.  Alcohol is never an allowable expense.

Sharon and John may give you edits, but once the form has been approved you can convert the document to PDF to be uploaded to CONCUR.



## Submitting report via CONCUR
Navigate to the [CONCUR website](https://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/penntravel/expense-report.html), click on the "CONCUR" icon, and sign in with your PennKey


### Start Your Report
- Click _"Start a Report"_ on the top right, which will take you to the _Report Header_ page
<img src="/assets/images/startareport.png" alt="startareport">


### Complete Report Header
- _Type of Travel/Reimbursement_: if expense involves travel, you will select either domestic, international, local (<50mi.); any other expense, you will select Non-Travel Expense -- (for expenses that include overnight travel -- see "CONCUR Troubleshooting" for more helpful links & per diem)
- _Country Code_: Whatever country the expenses are from
- _Report Name_: Create an informative report name
- _Business Justification_: 1-2 sentences describing the report e.g., “Dr. Satterthwaite traveled to [city] to present data findings at [conference name]. See the expenditure justification report attached for all expenses.”
- _Trip Begin Date/Trip End Date_: if it’s a travel report, include those dates
- _LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE AS IS_
- Click _NEXT_ to continue

### CONCUR Report Main Page
- Select "New Expense" and select the category that best matches your expense
  - Note: each receipt must have it's own expense entry, each item on the receipt must be itemized below it's entry.
  - For Ex. If you are creating a report for a conference where you took a flight that had taxes and paid for conference registration, these would be two expenses under the same report. One expense will be “flight” which you will itemize for cost of flight and then taxes (see example below). The other expense will be listed as “conference fees” This can be tricky but Sharon Lui and Sophia Linguiti can be resources if you need help.
  - Note: Alcohol can never be reimbursed via University/Grant Funds and Taxes are not reimbursed. Can mark those items as "non-reimbursable" under the itemization
- Enter the vendor, transaction date, city, total amount, and a business justification similar to that listed on the report header.
- Click "attach receipt" on the bottom right where you will attach both the _receipt_ for the expense and the _expenditure justification form_
- Click _SUBMIT_ when you are done

  - You will get a notification within a few days if the concur report has been approved or if it has been sent back with  edits.
