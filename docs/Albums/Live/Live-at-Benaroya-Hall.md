# *Live at Benaroya Hall*

The acoustic 2003 concert was a benefit for **YouthCare**, a Seattle charity. The album was released on CD and on a limited edition, 4-lp, red wine colored vinyl exclusively through the [Ten Club](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/). Only 2,000 copies were pressed, each individually numbered by hand. The vinyl edition is famously difficult to find (a vinyl pressing of the record normally sells for an average of $2,000--it is Pearl Jam's rarest vinyl find).
