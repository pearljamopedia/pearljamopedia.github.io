# The release of *Riot Act*

Following a year-long break after the band's [Binaural](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Binaural) tour, Pearl Jam entered the studio in February of 2002 to record [Riot Act](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Riot-Act). The singles ["I Am Mine"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Riot-Act) and ["Save You"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Riot-Act) were on the album. *Riot Act* was released on November 12, 2002.

After leaving **Epic Records**, director **Tim Burton** asked Pearl Jam to write a song for his film, **Big Fish**, this became [Man of the Hour](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Compliation/rvm). 

[Lost Dogs](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Compliation/Lost-Dogs), a compliation album with rarities and B-sides was released, and [Live at the Garden](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/Live-at-the-Garden), a concert film featuring the band's July 8th, 2003 concert at **Madison Square Garden** in November of 2003. In 2004, the live album, [Live at Benaroya Hall](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Live/Live-at-Benaroya-Hall), which was recorded on October 22, 2003 and recorded at [Seattle](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Locations/Seattle-WA)'s **Benaroya Hall** was released on CD and vinyl. The vinyl edition of the album was only pressed 2,000 times (each was numbered individually by hand), and is famously difficult to find (a vinyl pressing of the record normally sells for an average of $2,000--it is Pearl Jam's rarest vinyl find). Another compliation album, [rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003)](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Compliation/rvm) was released. This was the end of **Epic Records** contract with Pearl Jam.
