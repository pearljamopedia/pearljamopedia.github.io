In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to schedule spaces for meetings. 

# Step 1: Login to Scheduling & Event Services

[Log in](https://upennmed.emscloudservice.com/web/Default.aspx) using your PennKey and click on `CREATE A RESERVATION`

# Step 2: Request a room

Click on `book now` next to `Request a Room`.


<img width="1418" alt="Step3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53891017/143114317-f90701d6-005d-4157-aeec-a50e55942d10.png">

Set the `Date`, `Start Time`, `End Time` to the desired value in the `Date & Time` tab. In this example, we are booking a room on Monday, Dec 6 2021. 

After setting the date and time, click on `Search`.

All the rooms that you can request would show up in the search with schedules shown in the bar chart. The dark-blue shaded slots indicate that the corresponding time periods have been booked and thus are not available. 

Note that the extended whiskers on both sides of a time block represent the overhead setup/preparation time that is alloted for a scheduled meeting. Therefore, time periods covered by the whiskers are also not available.


# Step 3: Decide on a room

Find a room that fit your scheduling needs. In our case we find an availability at RCH C309 Conference Room from 2pm to 3pm. Then click on the green plus sign next to the room that you want.

You will be prompted to provide the number of attendees and the setup type you would like. The boardroom style would be ideal if you have a relatively small group and expect lots of discussions to happen.

After you've filled out the number of attendees and the setup type, you will notice that the green plus sign next to your desired room disappears.

Now scroll all the way to the top and click on `Next Step`.

# Step 4: Go through the reservation services

Unless directly requested, you wouldn't need any caterer. So skip `Penn-Approved Caterer Information` and fill out `Event Description` with whatever is appropriate.

You can also ignore `Event Equipment` section, which describes the available equipments in the room that you've selected.

Unless absolutely necessary, please do not select anything under `MTP Equipment` section, as extra items or services might incur charges.

Same goes for `AV Rental Services`

For the billing information, you should already have the 26-digit Budget Code that you can directly paste into the blank field.

After you're done pasting the budget code, click on `Next Step`.
