# J Records and *Pearl Jam*

After taking part in the 2004 **Vote for Change** tour, Pearl Jam began work on their new album in November of 2004 (work was complete in February of 2006). The album included the singles ["World Wide Suicide"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Avocado) (a song that criticized the Iraq War), ["Life Wasted"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Avocado), and ["Gone"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Avocado). The new album was cited as a return to the ["Vs."](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Vs)-era sound. *Pearl Jam* was released on May 2, 2006 under **J Records** (the band's first release on the label). 

After the release of the album, Pearl Jam began their 2006 would tour around North America, Australia, and Europe (the band had not toured Europe in nearly six years).

The band contributed a song, a cover of [the Who](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Bands/Who)'s **Love, Reign o'er Me** for director **Mike Binder**'s film, **Reign Over Me**. A CD box set was released on June 26, 2007, [Live at the Gorge 05/06](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Live/theGorge0506) documenting the band's shows at **The Gorge Amphitheatre**. On September 25, 2007, a concert film was released, [Immagine in Cornice](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/Immagine-in-Cornice), documenting the band's 2006 Italian shows.
