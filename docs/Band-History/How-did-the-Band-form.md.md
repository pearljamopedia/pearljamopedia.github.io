# How did Pearl Jam form? 

Mid-1980s grunge band [Green River](https://google.com), home to [Jeff Ament](https://google.com) and [Stone Gossard](https://google.com), along with other musicians, disbanded in 1987. Later that year, Ament and Gossard began playing with [Andrew Wood](https://google.com), and this led to the creation of [Mother Love Bone](https://google.com). From 1988 to 1989, Mother Love Bone toured and recorded, but unfortunately, Wood passed away in 1990 due to an overdose.

Stunned by the death of Wood, Gossard began writing music that was more serious than his previous work. Afterwards, Gossard and Ament met with guitarist [Mike McCready](https://google.com) to send a demo tape to find a drummer and a singer. The tape was given to former [Red Hot Chilli Peppers](https://google.com) drummer [Jack Irons](https://google.com) to see if he would be interested in distributing the demo and joining the band. He did not accept the invitation, but Irons gave the demo to his friend, [San Diego, California](https://www.sandiego.gov) singer [Eddie Vedder](https://google.com).

Vedder recorded the vocals to what would become three Pearl Jam songs: ["Alive"](https://google.com), ["Once"](https://google.com), and ["Footsteps"](https://google.com); Vedder entitled these 3 songs Momma-Son, and two of the songs ("Alive" and "Once") earned a place on Pearl Jam's 1991 debut album, [Ten](https://google.com). The remaining song, "Footsteps", was placed on the compliation album, [Lost Dogs](https://google.com).

Originally, [Matt Cameron](https://google.com), [Soundgarden](https://google.com) drummer, was supposed to become the drummer, but due to his position in Soundgarden, Ament and Gossard recruited [Dave Krusen](https://google.com). Krusen auditioned, and became Pearl Jam's drummer.
