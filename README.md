## OVERVIEW
'Wiki' is a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia. It includes multiple pages where users can get more information regarding any topic. Users can also add new pages and help others by providing them with valuable information.


## WEBSITE LAYOUT
When users visit the homepage, they see two sections:
1. ***Left section*** includes most common user actions that they can perform, such as-
	 1. **Search Bar:** Users can search for a page using it's title. If they're not familiar with a title, they can search for all matching titles by providing part of the title as an input.
	  2. **Home:** Users can click on this link to be directed to the Homepage.
	  3. **Create New Page:** Users can create a new page. Each new page consists of a title and content section. Users are required to provide the content in "*Markdown*" template language. If a page with same title already exists, then they are prompted with suitable error message.
	  4. **Random Page:** Users can click on this link and it will take them to any one of the available pages at random.

2. ***Right section*** provides a list of all available pages. Users can click on them to visit a page directly.

On each page, users can see it's title and some content. They can edit it by clicking on "Edit Page" button at the top of the page. Within edit view, users can edit content of the original page but not it's title. After editing, users can save their changes by clicking on "Save" button or discard it by clicking on "Cancel" button.

If users already know the title of a page then they can also visit it by appending "*/wiki/TITLE*", where *TITLE* is the title of the page, to base URL. For example to visit a page with title as '*Git*', users can append '*/wiki/Git*' to base URL. It will take them directly to the requested page. However if the page is not found, then they are prompted with a suitable error message.
