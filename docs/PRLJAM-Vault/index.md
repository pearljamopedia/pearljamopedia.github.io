# The PRLJAM Vault

Welcome to **the PRLJAM Vault**, a collection of **hundreds(?)** of pieces of media following Pearl Jam throughout the years. Interviews, performances, awards, and so much more are to be found in **the PRLJAM Vault**. One day, all those cool little clips of Pearl Jam on platforms such as **YouTube** will be gone. It could be tomorrow, or in 10 years. So, the goal of **the PRLJAM Vault** is to create a platform solely for the gathering of these pieces of media. 

Every month, we reach into the Vault and pull out 5 videos, they can be from the 90s, or they can be from Pearl Jam's most recent shows. So, here it is: **the PRLJAM Vault**.

A note about all of this: *These videos are all hosted on YouTube, as the platform will survive for the forseeable future. All of these videos are being stored on a permanent, physical location as well as YouTube. On the day that YouTube (or the videos that are on it) is no more, the videos that are here will be switched to a dedicated host specifically for this website, instead of YouTube. Thanks.
