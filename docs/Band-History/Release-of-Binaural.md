# The release of *Binaural*

After touring for [Yield](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Yield), Pearl Jam took a break, but entered the studio once again in September of 1999 to record [Binaural](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Binaural). This was drummer [Matt Cameron](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Current-Members/Matt-Cameron)'s first album with the band. Including some of the darker songs coming from Pearl Jam's catalog, *Binaural* featured the singles ["Nothing As It Seems"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Binaural) and ["Light Years"](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Binaural). *Binaural* was released on May 16, 2000.

Every show of the **2000 Binaural Tour** was professionally recorded, as the band noticed that fans wanted to own a copy of shows they attended and the popularity of bootlegs, a way of recording performances that are not officially released by an artist. 

The European Tour came to an end on June 30, 2000 at the **Roskilde Festival** in Denmark, when nine fans were crushed and suffocated to death. When the band realized what was happening, it was already too late.

A month after the Roskilde tragedy, the band began the two-leg North American tour, and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their first performance, they played at **MGM Grand** in Las Vegas, NV. The next year after the tour, the concert film [Touring Band 2000](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/Touring-Band-2000) was released, documenting performances from the North American legs of the tour.
