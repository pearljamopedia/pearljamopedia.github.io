# The release of *Ten*

In March of 1991, Pearl Jam entered [London Bridge Studios](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Locations/London-Bridge-Studios) to record [Ten](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Albums/Studio/Ten). In May of 1991, [Dave Krusen](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Past-Members/Dave-Krusen/) left the band to check himself into rehabillitation for alcoholism, so he was replaced by [Matt Chamberlain](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Past-Members/Matt-Chamberlain/). Chamberlain played a few shows, but then left to join the [Saturday Night Live](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/SNL) band. He suggested [Dave Abbruzzese](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Past-Members/Dave-Abbruzzese/). Abbruzzese joined the band and played the rest of the shows for the Ten tour.

Ten was released on August 27, 1991. The name for the album was taken from then active-basketball player [Mookie Blaylock](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/People/Mookie-Blaylock)'s jersey number (10). The record did not sell very quickly upon its release, but in 1992, Ten was certified gold and reached number two on the [Billboard](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Brands-Companies/Billboard) charts.

With the success of the album, Pearl Jam became known as a key player in the upbrining of grunge, along with other Seattle factions [Alice in Chains](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Bands/Alice-in-Chains), [Soundgarden](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Bands/Soundgarden), and [Nirvana](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Bands/Nirvana).

Pearl Jam added two songs to the soundtrack for [Cameron Crowe](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/People/Cameron-Crowe)'s 1992 film, [Singles](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/Singles). These songs were ["State of Love and Trust"](https://google.com) and ["Breath"](https://google.com). The band also went on Saturday Night Live and [MTV Unplugged](https://pearljamopedia.ml/docs/Notable-Mentions/Television-Film/MTV-Unplugged).
