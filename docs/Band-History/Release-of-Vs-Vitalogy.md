# The release of Vs. and Vitalogy

At the [1993 MTV Video Music Awards], Pearl Jam received four awards for the music video for ["Jeremy"](https://google.com) including **Video of the Year** and **Best Group Video**. Afterwards, the band publicly made an effort to refrain from doing a music video for ["Black"](https://google.com), despite pressure from the record label. This brought the band to make a very small amount of music videos along the way, as the band did not want "people to remember our songs as videos".
