# General Custom Info To Flywheel Uploader

 This script takes as input a CSV file with the following characteristics:
 1. No Protected Health Information (PHI) in the file
 2. All columns are named
 3. The subject ID column is named "bblid"

 It then organizes the data into dictionaries and uploads it to each subject's Custom Info field on flywheel. The script can be called in the terminal by doing:
```
python customInfoUploader.py -d path/to/CSV -p name_of_project -n dict_name
```
For example, to upload data in a csv called "flavortown.csv" to my "GUY_FIERI" project on flywheel as a custom field called "recipes" I would do:
```
python customInfoUploader.py -d flavortown.csv -p GUY_FIERI -n recipes
```

*NOTE: Prior to uploading, please sign into a flywheel session in your environment. See here for instructions: https://flywheel-io.github.io/core/branches/master/python/getting_started.html*

See below for the script. You can also find it here: https://github.com/diegodav/general_customInfoUploader/blob/master/customInfoUploader.py
